         Release Notes for picoLisp-2.3.6
         ================================

A. There were serious bugs in 'evList()' and 'date', they were not gc-safe. This
   could cause a crash if garbage collection occurred at an unlucky moment.

B. The syntax of the 'newButton' GUI function changed slightly. This requires
   the modification of existing applications:

   1. In search dialogs, replace

         (when (=T Dst)
            (newButton
               '(newUrl '(+Cls) ...) ) )
   
      with

         (newButton T Dst '(+Cls) ...)

   i.e. an "able" expression becomes the first, and the 'Dst' parameter the
   second argument of 'newButton'


   2. In calls to search dialogs, if the first argument is 'T', it has to be
      replaced with 'NIL', e.g.

      (choDlg T ...)  ->  (choDlg NIL ...)

   or

      (choMyClass T)  ->  (choMyClass)


   3. If desired, additional attributes from the search fields of search dialogs
      can now be to the 'newButton' function. "app/gui.l" contains some
      examples.

C. When the "Esc" key is hit in the GUI, and JavaScript is enabled, an Ajax POST
   is done for the current form. User input is sent to the server, validated,
   and possible error messages are displayed. Thus, "Esc" has a new meaning:
   "Entry save and check".

D. 'hear' cannot be called any more with a symbolic file name. Instead, only a
   numeric file descriptor is allowed.

E. The two optional arguments to '+DelRowButton' are reversed. Now there is
   first the question for the confirmation alert, and then the additional
   action. This is more conformant with the usual button syntax, e.g.

      (gui 7 '(+DelRowButton) "Delete this stuff?" '(doSomethineElse))
