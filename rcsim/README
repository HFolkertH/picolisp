         RC Flight Simulator
         ===================

The Pico Lisp RC Flight Simulator is a very simple toy simulator, allowing you
to fly an airplane in a way similar to a radio controlled model plane.

It is all implemented within the Pico Lisp system, so that no additional
libraries like OpenGL or GL4Java are needed. It may be regarded as a proof of
concept, because a flight simulator is one of the least typical things to do in
Lisp.

The plane is similar to the German WW-I aircraft Fokker "D-VII" (and a bit to
the British Sopwith Camel ;-). Though the user's position is that of a model
plane's pilot (i.e. viewing the plane from a fixed position), all parameters
like dimensions, mass, engine power and flight data are intended to be as close
as possible to a "real" Fokker D-VII. Unfortunately, some of these parameters
are not known exactly, but it is a fun project anyway, and I hope it comes
close.


The simulator comes with two different kinds of user interface. The "official"
version runs in an Applet in any Java-enabled browser. To run it locally,
start the Pico Lisp server with

   $ ./p rcsim/main.l -main -go -wait

or (to get an interactive Pico Lisp command line) with

   $ ./p dbg.l rcsim/main.l -main -go

and then point your browser to "http://localhost:8080".

If you don't have Pico Lisp installed, you might want to try the online version
at:

   http://rcsim.software-lab.biz

(please take care not to use a proxy for that address)

In both cases, click onto the image to set the keyboard focus.


The second version uses the same graphical frontend, but written in 'C' instead
of Java. This is much faster on older machines. You'll have to build it once:

   $ (cd src; make x11)

Then start the Pico Lisp server with

   $ ./p dbg.l rcsim/xlib.main.l -main -go

and the Z3d-Client from another X-terminal

   $ bin/z3dClient localhost 8080

Then make sure that your keyboard focus is on the first X-terminal (where you
started the simulator from, _not_ the Z3d-Client window).

Hitting ENTER at the Pico Lisp prompt (the colon ':') will terminate the
simulation process and close the Z3d-Client window. As always, you can stop the
Pico Lisp servers with 'killall pico'.


The simulator runs in the background, so if it is started interactively (see
above), the Lisp interpreter is fully available and lets you inspect or modify
the environment. For example

: (show *Model)

shows the current state of the model.

In the Z3d-Version, terminal output is interlaced with the simulator's output.
If you see no ':' prompt, it is helpful to type a single dot '.' and ENTER, to
avoid terminating the interpreter:

...
0 %  0 km/h  0 m/s  1 m
.
-> NIL
:


The simulator is controlled by the following 8 keys:

- The cursor (arrow) keys UP and DOWN control the elevator
- The LEFT and RIGHT cursor keys control the combined rudder/ailerons
- The HOME key sets full throttle
- The END key turns the engine off
- PAGE UP/DOWN increase/decrease the throttle

For a first flight, just hit the HOME key as the plane sits waiting on the
runway, and watch it accelerate. After some time, when it starts to jump a bit
nervously, give a little up-elevator (the DOWN arrow key) to gain height. Then
hit the PAGE DOWN key once or twice to decrease the throttle, and cautiosly
experiment with with the arrow keys.


There is some rudimentary sound implemented. It is not inteded to be realistic
(the graphic isn't either ;-) but to give some audible feedback to the user. It
produces a simple square wave sound, depending on the engine's thrust, the
airspeed, the distance, and the doppler effect.

If you are using the Java/Applet version, you might simply click on the "Sound"
checkbox. Be warned, however, that this induces additional load on the client
side, and doesn't sound very smooth. BTW, does anybody know of a better way to
produce continuous sound with variable frequency in a Java applet?

In the Z3d-Client version, a console speaker interface is used, which gives
better results. As the speaker can be accessed in Linux only from a virtual
console (not from an X-terminal), log into a virtual console (typically tty1 ..
tty6) _before_ you start the simulator, change to the 'pico' directory, and run
the simple tone server:

   $ rcsim/tone

When done, you can stop it with 'killall tone'.
